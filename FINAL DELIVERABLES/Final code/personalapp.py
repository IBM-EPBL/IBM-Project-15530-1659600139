CHAPTER 1
1.INTRODUCTION
A Personal Expense Tracker Application is a particular form of digital diary that aids in keeping track of all of our cash transitions and moreover offers daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports on all financial activities.
 User receives alerts to keep track of income and expenses that can
system for tracking the application. All data is kept in offline mode for easy access at any time and from any location. The Daily Expense Tracker's user interface is incredibly straightforward and appealing, making it simple to grasp and the finest approach to record our financial data.

1.1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Simply put, personal finance includes all of the financial decisions and actions that a finance software facilitates by assisting you in effectively managing your finances. A personal finance software will not only assist you with accounting and budgeting, but it will also provide you with valuable advice on money management.
Users of personal finance applications will be prompted to enter their costs, after which their wallet balance will be updated and displayed to them. Users can also receive a graphical analysis of their expenses. They can choose to establish a cap on how much can be used in that month, and if the cap is surpassed, the user will receive an email alert.

1.2. PURPOSE
When you keep track of your spending, you can make sure your money is being utilised wisely and you will know where it goes. You can learn why you're in debt and how you got there by keeping track of your spending. You can then use this information to create a debt relief plan that works for you.
You may plan for both short-term and long-term expenses by using a budget to make sure you're not spending more than you're earning. It's a simple, practical solution for folks with all types of income and expenses to maintain order in their finances.

CHAPTER 2
2. LITERATURE SURVEY
A literature review is a piece of academic writing that places the academic literature on a particular topic in perspective to show knowledge of and understanding of it. This chapter shows the different techniques that have been implemented.

2.1. EXISTING PROBLEM
The expense tracker existing system does not offer the user portable device management level, is only used on desktop software, and is therefore impossible to update anywhere expenses are done and is unable to update the location of the expense details disrupting that the proposed system provides. The user's daily, weekly, and monthly spending must be maintained in Excel sheets and CSV files at the moment. The ability to conveniently keep track of one's everyday costs does not now have a fully comprehensive answer.To do this, one must maintain a journal in a diary or computer system, and all calculations must be made by the user, which might occasionally result in errors that cause losses. Due to imperfect data maintenance, the current system is not user friendly. The sole negative where the rest are absent from this endeavor is that there will be no reminder to stay a human on a specified date. This project won't have any information because it doesn't remind people to do anything each month, which has some drawbacks. However, it can be used to calculate income and expenses, so we suggest a new project to solve this issue.

2.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT DEFINITION
In our daily life money is the most important portion and without it we cannot last one day on earth but if we keep on track all financial data then we can overcome this problem. Most of the people cannot track their expenses and income one way they face the money crisis and depression. This situation motivates us to make an android app to track all financial activities. Using the Personal Expense Tracker Application user can be tracking expenses day to day and making life tension free.

3.  IDEATION & PROPOSED SOLUTION
3.1 EMPATHY MAP CANVAS

3.3.PROPOSED
SOLUTION

S.NO.
Parameter
Description

1.
Problem Statement
In a paper-based expense tracker system it is difficult to track our monthly expenses manually. In a paper-based expense tracker system it is difficult to track our monthly expenses manually. The paper-based expense records may get lost in
case of fire accidents, floods etc.
2.
Scalability of the Solution
This application can handle large numbers of users and data with high performance and security. This application can adapt for both large-scale and small-scale purposes. Easily available in all kinds
of devices.
3.
Idea / Solution description
Daily expense management system which is specially designed for non-salaried and salaried personnel for keeping track of their daily expenditure in an easy and effective way through a computerized system which tends to eliminate manual paperwork. Personal finance applications will ask users to add their expenses and based on their expenses wallet balance will be updated which will be visible to the user. They have an option to set a limit for the amount to be used for that particular month if the limit is exceeded the user will be notified with an email alert.
4.
Novelty / Uniqueness
The user gets notified when their expense exceeds the limit and also it reminds the user when they forgot to make an entry. Tracking expenses through SMS. Data analytics on expenses. Future expense prediction
5.
Social Impact / Customer Satisfaction
The application should be able to generate reports of their spending and notify users if they have exceeded their budget. It is designed to be dynamic to produce the prediction. It also provides users’ personal information, their income as well as their expenses. This application can create awareness among common people about finance and stuff. This application also helps users to be financially responsible. It Reduces time rather than entering
details manually.
6.
Business Model (Revenue Model)
This Application is provided for free of cost. But It will have some advertisements. In premium version there is no advertisement and contains
some additional features.

 RESULTS

9.1Performance Metrics

An application can be a very powerful tool for businesses if once the app becomes a success. However, the success of an app is measured
through numbers, metrics, and analytics.

Developing an app takes quite a lot, so once you’ve dedicated much time, money, and effort to the process,

it’s mandatory to measure mobile app performance.

CHAPTER 10
ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES

10.1 Advantages


• Improved customer service
• Cloud - based solution
• Order Fulfillment
• Harness Customer Loyalty and Retention

10.2 Disadvantages

 • System Clash
 • Reduced Physical Audits
 • No solution to improve or eliminate bottlenecks in the service cycle
CHAPTER 11
11. CONCLUSION

Taking proper care of our record is crucial in every business, no matter how big or little, we must understand. We must educate ourselves about the idea of effective inventory management and its applications because we can see that managers do not fully grasp it. A company's inventory management system is one of the reasons for its failure. Many customs to combat failure are present, and we can start from this point. Modern technologies can support us in managing and keeping an eye on our inventory. We may learn, put new ideas into practice, and assess our company.

CHAPTER 12
12. FUTURE SCOPE

1) It will have a variety of record-keeping choices (such as food, travel expenses, salary, etc.).
2) It will continue to give updates about our daily spending automatically.
3)  Despite being in a haste to make money in today's hectic and expensive world, we eventually gave up. As we naively waste money on unnecessary items and titles. We came over with the intention of following our profit.
4) The user can specify their own expense categories here, such as those for food, clothing, rent, and bills, where they must input the money that has been spent.
