Description:

Finance apps make your life easier by helping you manage your finances efficiently by automating all your financial decisions and activities. 
Budgeting and accounting are just a few things a personal finance app can do for you, but it will also give you useful insights into managing
your money as well.

Wallet balances will be updated for users based on their expenses in personal finance applications. Graphical representations of users' 
expenditures are also available. An email alert will be sent to users if the limit is exceeded for a particular month. Users can set a limit
for how much they will use during that period.
